_**Running the Project**_

To run the project, you can use one of the following methods:

1. Use a live server to open the game.
2. Use a live preview feature in your code editor.
3. Open the homePage.html file directly in your web browser.

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to recreate the iconic Pac-Man game with smooth animations, responsive controls, and an enjoyable gaming experience. The following features and requirements should be implemented:

-   Implement the Pac-Man character that can navigate a maze and consume pellets.
-   Design and render a maze layout with walls and corridors for Pac-Man to navigate.
-   Create ghosts that chase Pac-Man and introduce gameplay mechanics such as power pellets and fruit bonuses.
-   Maintain a consistent `frame rate of at least 60 FPS` to ensure smooth animations and gameplay.
-   Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's score and display it on the screen.
-   Include a countdown timer indicating the remaining time for each level.
-   Implement a pause menu that allows the player to pause, restart, and continue the game without any frame drops or interruptions.

**Utilize the available development tools and techniques to optimize rendering performance and ensure an enjoyable gaming experience.**

## Instructions

To play the game, use the following controls:

-   Enter: Start The Game.
-   Up Arrow: Move Pac-Man up.
-   Down Arrow: Move Pac-Man down.
-   Left Arrow: Move Pac-Man left.
-   Right Arrow: Move Pac-Man right.
-   Spase: Pause the game.
-   the Reset button: restart the game for the player

Navigate Pac-Man through the maze, collect all the pellets, avoid the ghosts, and try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Development Tools

We strongly recommend utilizing the developer tools available in web browsers. These tools will assist you in the development process:

-   **Page Inspector**: View and edit page content and layout.
-   **Web Console**: Monitor console logs and interact with the page using JavaScript.
-   **Performance Tool**: Analyze site responsiveness, performance, JavaScript execution, and layout performance. This tool is especially useful for monitoring FPS, frame drops, function execution time, and other relevant metrics.

Utilize the available developer tools to enhance your development experience and optimize your game's performance. The Performance Tool, in particular, will provide valuable insights into FPS, frame drops, and other metrics.

Project was Written in **js** using only allowed libraies (with no react js nor node js) and without canva or any frame-works.

## Tasks

This project will help you learn and practice the following concepts:

-   JavaScript
-   Styles
-   Layout
-   Image manipulation
-   CompositingRendering
-   Tile maps

We recommend using Firefox or Chrome as your preferred browsers during the development process.

Embrace the challenge of recreating Pac-Man and have fun with the development process!

Best of luck with your game development journey!
