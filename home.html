            <p>
                In this newly introduced academic program, known as 'Piscine Pacman' students
                are required to successfully complete various projects in order to complete it. Each
                project consists of a set number of audits that students must pass. However, it
                should be noted that if a student fails three audits within a project, they will
                be deemed unsuccessful and will be required to repeat the project. As part of
                the evaluation process, there are three auditors who have the authority to
                assign a failing grade: Amail, Fatabbas, Emahfood, and Akhaled
